                DoConnect allows users to register, login, ask questions, and answer them. Questions asked and answers will go into pending state. There are also Admin role. Admins can delete or approve pending content so all users can view. The project offers a robust and user-friendly web application experience. DoConnect is a full-stack project that utilizes a combination of Java, Spring Framework, Angular, MySQL, JWT, and Hibernate. Java serves as the primary backend programming language, handling data processing and business logic. The Spring Framework provides core infrastructure and support for web application development, including inversion of control and security features. On the frontend, Angular enables the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces. The project's data is stored and managed in MySQL, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval. JWT is employed for secure authentication and authorization, generating tokens to validate user identity and access privileges. Additionally, Hibernate simplifies data handling between Java objects and the database, reducing boilerplate code.
